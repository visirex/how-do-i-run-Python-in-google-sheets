# how-do-i-run-Python-in-google-sheets
where can I store my code using google cloud platform if I want to run my code in google sheets all day? would cloud run or cloud function or cloud engine be the best option - if so which one? or do you recommend something else?   is there a code or script that allows for me to query directly from google sheets to big query without using Sheets data connector - -perhaps python or java script can perform this function? does the google sheets api along big query api allows for CRUD operation to update data stored in any of my big query tables?  if so, can you provide a link to discover the script?
